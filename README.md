#### Weekly Challenge to practice querying SQLite Databases using the Jupyter Notebook.


## Overview
This week we are utilizing SQLite Databases and querying them utilizing the Jupyter notebook. We were given an SQLite Database of temperature and precipitation data taken on Hawaii and will be querying this database, taking the data from the query an putting it into a list, then coverting it to a DataFrame for analyzing and calculating summary statistics.




## Results

Because we are analyzing temperatures for Hawaii, temperate data for the months and June and December do not vary much.
